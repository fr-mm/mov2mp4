===============================================================================

üçé HOW TO UNLOCK THE APPLICATION ON macOS

macOS may block the application for security reasons. This is normal and 
happens with applications downloaded from the internet that have not been 
digitally signed by Apple. Follow the steps below to use the application:

===============================================================================
üìã METHOD 1: USING SYSTEM PREFERENCES (EASIER)
===============================================================================

1. üì• DOWNLOAD AND EXTRACT THE FILE
   - Download the "mov2mp4-macOS.zip" file from GitHub
   - Double-click to extract
   - You will see the "mov2mp4-macos" file

2. üñ±Ô∏è TRY TO OPEN THE APPLICATION
   - Double-click on the "mov2mp4-macos" file
   - macOS will show a blocking message
   - Click "OK" to close the message

3. ‚öôÔ∏è GO TO SYSTEM PREFERENCES
   - Click on the Apple menu (üçé) in the upper left corner
   - Choose "System Preferences" (or "System Settings" on macOS 13+)
   - Click on "Security & Privacy"

4. üîì UNLOCK THE APPLICATION
   - In the "General" tab, you will see a message like:
     "mov2mp4-macos was blocked because it is from an unidentified developer"
   - Click the "Open Anyway" button next to the message
   - Enter your administrator password if requested
   - Click "Open" in the confirmation window

5. ‚úÖ DONE!
   - The application can now be run normally
   - You only need to do this once

===============================================================================
üìã METHOD 2: USING TERMINAL (ALTERNATIVE)
===============================================================================

If Method 1 doesn't work, use Terminal:

1. üîç OPEN TERMINAL
   - Press Cmd + Space
   - Type "Terminal" and press Enter

2. üìÅ NAVIGATE TO THE APPLICATION FOLDER
   - Type: cd Downloads
   - Press Enter
   - (Adjust the path if downloaded to another location)

3. üîß REMOVE QUARANTINE
   - Type exactly: sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine mov2mp4-macos
   - Press Enter
   - Enter your password when prompted
   - Press Enter again

4. üîë GIVE EXECUTION PERMISSION
   - Type: chmod +x mov2mp4-macos
   - Press Enter

5. ‚úÖ TEST THE APPLICATION
   - Type: ./mov2mp4-macos
   - Press Enter
   - The application should open normally

===============================================================================
‚ùì WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN?
===============================================================================

macOS has a security system called "Gatekeeper" that protects your 
computer from malicious applications. Since this application was created by an 
independent developer and was not digitally signed by Apple, the 
system blocks it as a precaution.

This is completely normal and safe to unlock when you trust the 
application (as in this case, where the source code is available on GitHub).

===============================================================================
üé¨ HOW TO USE THE APPLICATION
===============================================================================

After unlocking:

1. üìÅ SELECT A MOV FILE
   - Click "Select"
   - Choose your .mov file

2. üéØ SET THE NUMBERS
   - Scene: Enter a number from 0 to 99 (e.g., 5 becomes 05)
   - Shot: Enter a number from 0 to 9999 (e.g., 123 becomes 0123)

3. üëÄ SEE THE PREVIEW
   - The filename appears automatically
   - Example: "Anim_sc05_sh0123.mp4"

4. üöÄ CONVERT
   - Click "üé¨ Convert to MP4"
   - The MP4 file will be saved in the same folder as the original file

===============================================================================
üîß TROUBLESHOOTING
===============================================================================

   ‚Üí Try Method 2 using Terminal
